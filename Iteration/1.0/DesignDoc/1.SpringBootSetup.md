# Spring Boot Setup for Review and Moderation Services

## Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of how to set up the **Review** and **Moderation** services in a single **Spring Boot** application. These services interact using **Kafka** as a messaging queue. We'll also cover how to handle **MySQL** for persistent storage and **Redis** for caching. The services will be deployed using **Docker** for containerization.

## Services Overview

1. **Review Service**: Handles CRUD operations for product reviews and interacts with the Moderation service for review validation.
2. **Moderation Service**: Processes reviews sent for moderation via a Kafka message queue.

 #### how will the moderation service communicate back to app via kafka?

##### Kafka Configuration
Topic: review-moderation
Producer: Sends review messages from the Review service to the Moderation service.
Consumer: The Moderation service consumes the review messages and processes them.

This structure will allow the Reviews service to understand the moderation result and update the relevant review in its database.

##### Kafka Configuration for Reviews Service (Consumer):

The Reviews service should be configured to listen to the review-moderation-feedback topic.
We need to set up a Kafka consumer in the Reviews service that listens for moderation feedback messages and updates the review status in the database.
Kafka Configuration for Moderation Service (Producer):

After the Moderation service processes a review, it will publish the result to the review-moderation-feedback topic.
You need to set up a Kafka producer in the Moderation service to publish these moderation results.

When the Moderation service processes a review, it can publish a message to the review-moderation-feedback topic with information like:
```json
{
  "reviewId": 123,
  "status": "approved",  // could be "rejected" or "pending"
  "moderationComments": "Looks good!"
}
```

This structure will allow the Reviews service to understand the moderation result and update the relevant review in its database.


### Docker Setup

# Use a base image for Java
FROM openjdk:17-jre-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the jar file to the container
COPY target/review-moderation-service.jar /app/review-moderation-service.jar

# Expose the port that the app will run on
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/review-moderation-service.jar"]


##### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  reviews-service:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/reviews_db
    depends_on:
      - mysql
      - kafka
      - redis

  moderation-service:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/review_moderation_db
    depends_on:
      - mysql
      - kafka
