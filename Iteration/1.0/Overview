Project Overview
This project is designed to implement a Review Service as part of a broader e-commerce platform. The service handles functionalities such as review submission, moderation by admins, and deletion by users. To ensure scalability and responsiveness, the service integrates a number of key technologies such as Spring Boot, Debezium, Kafka, SQL Database, and Redis. It also utilizes Wiremock for simulating dependent services during development and testing. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the setup and design choices.

Steps
Step 1: Setting up the Spring Boot Service
The core of this system is built on Spring Boot, which simplifies the development of RESTful web services by providing a well-structured and configurable framework. In this step, we set up a basic Spring Boot project, including configurations for essential dependencies like Spring Data JPA for interacting with the SQL database, and Spring Web for exposing the RESTful API endpoints.

Spring Boot allows you to quickly build and run the service locally, providing an embedded server, which simplifies the setup for microservices. In this case, the Review Service includes several REST endpoints for creating, reading, and deleting reviews, which can later be moderated by admins.

Step 2: Integrating Kafka for Asynchronous Communication
Since the platform supports real-time moderation, the Review Service needs to interact asynchronously with a Moderation Service. We use Apache Kafka to achieve this asynchronous, event-driven communication. Kafka acts as a message broker between the services. When a user submits a review, the service pushes a message onto a Kafka topic that the Moderation Service consumes.

This step involves configuring Kafka topics and understanding the producer-consumer pattern in Kafka. The Review Service acts as the producer, publishing the new review data, and the Moderation Service, running independently, consumes these events.

Step 3: Implementing Debezium for Data Change Capture
To maintain data integrity and synchronization across services, we leverage Debezium, an open-source distributed platform that captures row-level changes in your database. This ensures that when the Moderation Service modifies the status of a review (e.g., from "pending" to "approved" or "rejected"), those changes are reflected in the Review Serviceâ€™s database without requiring a direct connection between the two services.

In this step, we configure Debezium connectors to listen to the SQL database for changes, which are then streamed to Kafka topics. This ensures that any changes made by the Moderation Service are reflected back in the Review Service.

Step 4: Setting Up SQL Database for Persistent Data Storage
For persistent storage of reviews and moderation data, we use a SQL database. This structured data store allows us to store reviews with fields such as review_id, product_id, user_id, rating, and content. SQL ensures that we can query, update, and delete reviews efficiently, making it ideal for applications where relational integrity and complex queries are required.

The Review Service interacts with the SQL database through Spring Data JPA, which abstracts away the boilerplate code for CRUD operations and makes database interactions more seamless. In this step, we also set up database migrations using tools like Flyway or Liquibase to version and manage schema changes.

Step 5: Introducing Redis for Caching
To reduce latency and improve performance, especially under high traffic, Redis is introduced as a caching layer. Redis stores frequently accessed data such as recently created reviews or reviews for a specific product in memory, significantly reducing the time it takes to fetch this data compared to querying the SQL database directly.

In this step, Redis is set up as a cache for specific endpoints, like fetching reviews by product. The Review Service checks the Redis cache before querying the SQL database, thus improving response times. Redis also helps manage temporary data, such as in-progress moderation results.

Step 6: Local Testing and Service Simulation with Wiremock
For local testing and development, we use Wiremock to mock the Moderation Service. This allows the Review Service to run and be tested independently, without requiring the full e-commerce ecosystem to be deployed. Wiremock helps simulate the behavior of the Moderation Service, so you can mock responses for different review states (e.g., approved, rejected).

This step involves creating mock services and endpoints with Wiremock, which can return predefined responses. This is crucial for testing how the Review Service behaves when it receives different types of feedback from the Moderation Service. Wiremock also supports various testing scenarios, such as network failures or slow responses, making it a valuable tool for testing the robustness of the Review Service.

Conclusion
By using a combination of Spring Boot, Kafka, Debezium, SQL, Redis, and Wiremock, this e-commerce Review Service is designed to be scalable, resilient, and responsive. It ensures efficient data processing and caching while allowing for easy local testing and integration with other microservices in the system. Future enhancements could include adding security layers, more advanced caching strategies, and scaling the Kafka infrastructure to handle larger volumes of data.
